My First Portfolio on CSS Advance

Welcome to My CSS Advance, a simple project showcasing modern web development design concepts like Flexbox layout, responsive design, and proper use of semantic HTML elements. This project includes a multi-section webpage built with HTML and styled using CSS to create a clean, flexible layout.

Features

-Responsive Layout: The webpage adapts to different screen sizes using Flexbox for dynamic element positioning.
-Semantic HTML: Proper HTML5 semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` are used for improved accessibility and SEO.
-CSS Styling: Custom styling is applied via two CSS files (`base.css` and `styles.css`) to create a consistent and visually appealing design.
-Scrollable Content: Both the `<article>` and `<aside>` sections are scrollable to ensure content remains accessible even with long entries.

Technologies Used

**HTML5**: For building the structure of the page.
**CSS3**: For styling and layout using Flexbox.
**Git & GitHub**: For version control and project management.
